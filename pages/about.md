## About the team

Ava is studying Public Relations and is the Project Manager. Her role includes managing and organizing our Google Drive, submitting all group assignments to Canvas, and keeping the team up to date with instructor comments and grades on assignments.

Tessa is studying Public Relations and is the Collection Manager. Her role includes monitoring all the data we have found for our research collection. This role makes sure that we are finding different data pieces across different mediums, as well as data that is legal to download, from notable sources, and relates to our topic.

Ellie is studying both Advertising and Journalism and is the GitHub and Compository Manager. Her role includes learning all the tips and tricks to GitHub and our final data collection. Ellie must stay up to date on the new skills to ensure the website will work correctly when uploaded and our composite stays consistent and orderly.

We all worked within this repository to make sure it was efficiently run.

## Human Reaearch and Data Management

This course Human Reaearch and Data Management 350, CRN 25792 was taken in the Winter term of the 2024-25 school year. Under the guidance of Franny Gaede a Scholarly Publishing Librarian.

This course is centered around the theory and practices of how people who work in libraries, galleries, archives and museums manage data. We created this collection within the course to become better aquainted with this process.

## Institutions
We pulled content from various sources to ensure that our collection was well rounded. This list includes: The New York Public Library, The MET, Newfeilds, The Getty, The University of California Calisphere, Internet Archive, The Art Institute of Chicago, and The Digital Public Library of America.

Thank you to our professors, peers, and institutions that contributed to the creation of this collection.

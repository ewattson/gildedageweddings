****Data Management Plan****

**Project Description**
The theme for our collection of data is Gilded Age Weddings, this is referring to weddings during the years of 1870-1920. Weddings have been happening since the beginning of time and are ceremonies meant to solidify and celebrate the love between two people. Although styles are constantly changing and evolving as time passes, many aspects withstand the test of time. Seeing how themes have changed but certain elements have stayed steady highlights what makes a wedding tasteful and timeless. This collection of images displays invitations, dresses, and wedding festivities along with newspaper clippings and music excerpts. It invites the viewer to observe the variety of aspects within a wedding during the glitz and glam of the Gilded Age. All of the collection elements have been pulled from a series of libraries, archives and museums, and aggregators. Our intended audience includes historians, researchers, and wedding enthusiasts. Groups interested in historical fashion, material culture, and social customs will also find value in our collection. Scholars researching the Gilded Age can find our helpful collection for examining gender roles and cultural influence on wedding practices. Those who may choose to plan historically inspired weddings can find value in our collections by drawing inspiration from the timeless elegance of the Gilded Age. Weddings during the Gilded Age attracted many different audiences seeking different purposes, although all will appreciate the extravagance and enduring traditions during the Gilded Age weddings.

Tessa is studying Public Relations and is the Collection Manager. Her role includes monitoring all the data we have found for our research collection. This role makes sure that we are finding different data pieces across different mediums, as well as data that is legal to download, from notable sources, and relates to our topic.

**Expected Data**
Within this project we have a variety of data types including .jpg, .pdf, and .mp3’s within the set. These files are stored in a shared Google Drive, in a desktop folder on a laptop, and within the GitHub repository. Additionally, our Collection Builder website is also a part of our data collection.

**Period of Data Retentio**
We will leave our curated digital collection website up indefinitely. As a team we plan to periodically check our website every few months in case the site crashes and the data becomes unavailable. If this happens as a team we will trouble shoot ideas until our website is working once again.

**Data Formats and Dissemination**
e data will be shared within our class presentation. We will share our curated collection and repository with our peers in order to expand our project's audience. Our data will also be shared on the public web where anyone will have the ability to access our site and use our data as they please.
| Type | Size | Location | Amount |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| .jpg | \<200 KB | GitHub Objects Folder & Shared Google Folder | 16 |
| .pdf | \<371 MB | GitHub Objects Folder & Shared Google Folder | 2 |
| .mp3 | \<4.5 MB | GitHub Objects Folder & Shared Google Folder | 2 |

**Data Storage and Preservation of Access** 
The format of the data within this data collection is Google Sheets. The Sheet is then linked to a GitHub repository where the data files will be digitally compiled into an interactive website. Additionally we will archive our GitHub repository to Zenodo along with the meta data csv so it can continue to be accessible. The website will remain active and accessible to the public until the software crashes or is no longer available.

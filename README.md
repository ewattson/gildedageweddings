## Human Reaearch and Data Management 

This course Human Reaearch and Data Management 350, CRN 25792, was taken in the Winter term of the 2024-25 school year. Under the guidance of Franny Gaede a Scholarly Publishing Librarian.

This course is centered around the theory and practices of how people who work in libraries, galleries, archives and museums manage data. We created a collection within the course to become better aquainted with this process.

We chose to cultivate a collection surrounding weddings within the Gilded Age. The Gilded Age was a period in American history in which industrialization was rapidly growing. Which was shown through great wealth and prosperity, displayed in this collection through weddings. The collection "Gilded Age Weddings" can be viewed here: https://ewattson.github.io/gildedageweddings/

## Data Management Plan
This collection of images displays invitations, dresses, and wedding festivities along with newspaper clippings and music excerpts. It invites the viewer to observe the variety of aspects within a wedding during the glitz and glam of the Gilded Age. All of the collection elements have been pulled from a series of libraries, archives and museums, and aggregators. Our intended audience includes historians, researchers, and wedding enthusiasts. Groups interested in historical fashion, material culture, and social customs will also find value in our collection.

Our extensive Data Management Plan can be viewed within our collection here: https://ewattson.github.io/gildedageweddings/DMP.html
